# NCY-TOD dataset

NCY-TOD is a large scale benchmark proposed in **[Contextualized Spatial-Temporal Network for Taxi Origin-Destination Demand Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8720246)**. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first benchmark of taxi origin-destination demand prediction. You can download this dataset from [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ft4i0i0bysoox55/NYC-TOD.tar.gz?dl=0/)

## Region Partition 
We can get the geographic coordinates of all regions by running 
```
python grid_split.py 
```

The generated ```mymap.html``` records many ```PolylineCoordinates```, each of which is the longitude and latitude of a region.

```
var PolylineCoordinates = [
new google.maps.LatLng(40.737886, -73.973962),
new google.maps.LatLng(40.745005, -73.968711),
new google.maps.LatLng(40.741141, -73.959645),
new google.maps.LatLng(40.734022, -73.964896),
];
```

## OD Demand Data
The OD demand of every time interval is recorded in `oddata.npy`.

## Meteorological Data
`weather.npy` records the temperature, windchill, humidity, visibility, wind speed, precipitation and 23 types of weather conditions of NYC during every time interval.

## Meta Data
The meta data is not used in this work, but we can explore its effect in future works.
